# EMG_AG
Github repository for the development of an EMG signal classifier trained by a genetic algorithm

This python script reads the *.txt files, that contain EMG signals. The data are filtered and processed by emgReaderClass and then passed to the genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm trains a neural network-like classifier for determining which movement that each signal correlates to.
